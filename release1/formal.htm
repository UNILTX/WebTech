            Shanghai cuisine has many distinctive features:<br>
            
            First of all, pay attention to fresh materials. It selects <strong>seasonal food</strong> , mainly fish and shrimp from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and takes live fish as the best . There are live fish for guests to choose from all the year round, and it is cooked alive on the spot.<br>
            
            Second, there are many <strong>dishes with different seasons</strong> .<br>
            
            Third, pay attention to <strong> cooking methods</strong>  and constantly improve.<br>
            
            The fourth is the change of <strong> taste preference</strong> . In the past, Shanghai cuisine was based on thick soup, thick sauce and thick taste. Later, it gradually changed to moderate marinades, with light and elegant sauces and thick oil and red sauce. It pays attention to freshness, tenderness, color and salty taste.<br>
        
            What's more, Shanghainese formal dinner has the order of food: cold dishes, hot dishes, dim sum, soup. And here, let's focus on the first three.</p>

                <li class="aa">Cold Dishes</li>
                <li ><ul>
                    <li>In Shanghai restaurant, there are 4 to 50 kinds of cold dishes, including vegetables, fish, roasted, pickled, smoked and fried sauce, and white chopped. <br>
                        The taste is salty, sweet and fresh.<br> 
                        The cold dish made by The Shanghainese with vegetables is quite delicate and refreshing, simply seasoned with salt, sugar and sesame oil, and is already delicious.<br>
                        Rich in cold dishes of meat, fish smoked and fried, shrimp can be drunk and oil explosion, pig tongue pig tail to eat lees...<br>
                         Flavor from clear to thick, Shanghainese usually eat from the order of vegetable, white meat, red meat, to taste cold dishes.

                <ol>
                
            
                <li class="aa">Hot Dishes</li>
                <li><ul>
                    <li>Entrees are not limited to braised dishes with thick oil and red sauce, but also stir-fried and steamed.<br>
                        If you can't get used to the oily, braised yellow croaker. Try steamed yellow croaker with slices of ham and bamboo shoots, chicken oil and wine.<br>
                     The fish, with ham and broth, is salty and smooth with a sweet finish. Lion balls also distinguish between braised one. Chicken casserole soup with yellow bud white, small fire stewed pork balls, soft and delicate, more edible than the braised version. <br>
                     However,for me, braised pork in brown sauce is my favorite. The sauce goes with the rice and it's delicious. <br>
                     In Shanghainese cuisine, the vegetables in the hot dishes are exquisitely-cooked, and a variety of stir-fried, wine-flavoured salads and soups are even more enticing than meat dishes.<br>

                <li><ul>
                    <li> As Shanghaiese love sweet, there're various kinds of dessert. <br>
                        And I would like to introduce the mini rice balls with sweet wine.
                        Whether it is a dessert at the end of the New Year's Eve dinner or a snack in daily life, Shanghai people have a unique love for rice balls with sweet wine.<br>
                        Sweet wine and soft small balls is a symbol of union of the family.
