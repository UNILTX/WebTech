    <p>  When you fall in love with a city, you usually start with food.<br>
         A classic snack, shanghainese call it <strong>"dim sum".</strong><br>
         There are many kinds of breakfast in Shanghai, such as sheng jian, guo Tie, baozi, steamed bun, ma ball... , all delicious breakfast choices you can make in the morning.<br>
         However, in the hearts of old Shanghainese, the most classic breakfast is nothing more than the "four king Kong" -- Da Bing（大饼）, soybean milk（豆浆）, fried dough sticks（油条） and Ci Fan（瓷饭团）<br><br>

            <li class="aa">Deep-Fried Dough Stick</li>
            <li ><ul>
                <li>I like to see the fried dough sticks. They fry long strips of dough in the frying pan. The dough gradually expands until it becomes golden on both sides and floats in the oil.
            </ul></li>
        
            <li class="aa">Da Bing</li>
            <li><ul>
                <li>It's a kind of flatbread baked in the oven and sprinkled with sesame seeds. When the dough is flattened and close to the fire, a whiff of burnt wheat and sesame wafts through, the flatbread is formed.
            </ul></li>
        
            <li class="aa">Soy-bean milk</li>
            <li><ul>
                <li>Authentic old Shanghai soy milk and flatbread, the same salty, sweet points. Most Shanghainese like to mix salty soy milk with chili oil, pickled mustard and shrimps.
               
            </ul></li>
        
            <li class="aa">Ci Fan</li>
            <li><ul>
                <li>Shanghainese especially like to wrap different ingredients such as fried dough sticks, pickled mustard greens and sausages in the middle of the rice ball. Steamed glutinous rice and kneaded into rice ball, with a trace of glutinous rice sweet and chewy, folder with different ingredients to eat together, a great satisfaction.
             </ul></li>

    <p>You can get real Shanghai dim sum almost <strong>anywhere</strong>, as long as you get up early.<br>
         Maybe the dim sum from the stall not far from the hotel is delicious.<br>
        If you really want to sit in and enjoy it, <strong>Taoyuan Village</strong>, a snack restaurant in Shanghai, is recommended. There are not only the four King Kong, but also the wontons and xiaolongbao that Shanghainese usually eat in the morning or at noon, as well as the noodles mixed with scallion oil, which I highly recommend.<br>
        <strong>Address</strong>:405 Taizhou Road, Jing 'an District, Shanghai / 150 Hubin Road, Huangpu District, Shanghai
