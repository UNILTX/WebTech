    <h1>Xin Tian Di</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Shanghai Xintiandi is an urban tourist attraction with the historical and cultural features of Shanghai and the integration of Chinese and western culture.(photo credit to @Allen Yuan<br>
         Shanghai Xintiandi is based on the old area of Shikumen architecture, a symbol of Shanghai's modern architecture.<br>
        The original residential function of Shikumen has been changed for the first time, and the commercial operation function has been innovatively endowed. <br>
         The old house reflecting the history and culture of Shanghai has been transformed into a fashion, leisure and cultural entertainment center with functions such as catering, shopping and performing arts. <br>
         Stroll xintiandi, as if back in time, like place oneself in 20 or 30 s of the 20th century in Shanghai, but step into each building interior, is very modern and fashion, a new unique experience of idea, the organic combination with strewn at random have send to arrange a symphony of Shanghai yesterday, tomorrow and today, let visitors to taste the unique culture at home and abroad.</p>

    <h1>Around XinTianDi</h1>
    <hr>
    <p> Xintiandi is more like a cultural community than a scenic spot. Every day someone sits outside drinking coffee and chatting, it becomes a way of life. <br> 
    I like the freedom and romance there. <br>
    (click the left part of the picture to see more about a more detailed guide to Xintiandi )<br>
    Xintiandi, which contains many shopping malls with Chinese designer brands, is also popular with young people. In the evenings, the bars are also popular.<br>
    Although xintiandi is becoming more modern and younger, it also includes the site of the first meeting of the Chinese Communist Party, which is also of monumental significance to Chinese people. No entrance fee is required, and you can also visit it if you pass by.<br>(click the right part of the picture to see more about the history of Xintiandi when it held the first Chinese Communist Party )
