    <h1>Jin'An Temple</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Jing 'an Temple, one of the earliest Buddhist temples in Shanghai, has a history of more than 1,700 years.<br>
        Today's Jing 'an Temple is in the center of Shanghai, located in modern buildings. <br>
        The four lion roaring statues on the high pillars in front of the temple are golden. The top of the pagoda at the back of the temple is covered with gold. If you look at the whole temple from afar, a golden roof is particularly conspicuous, shining in the sun.

Because of the convenient transportation, it is very convenient to come to Jing 'an Temple to burn incense and worship Buddha, so incense is also very strong.<br>

At the bottom of the first floor of Jing 'an Temple, next to the Jing 'an Pagoda, you can see the vegetarian vegetarian restaurant, but usually the door leading to the restaurant from the inside of Jing 'an Temple is locked, so you have to go out of Jing 'an Temple and go around the restaurant from the outside. On the first and fifteenth days of each month, the door to the Su Zhai restaurant in Jing 'an Temple will be opened, and you can enter the restaurant directly from the jing 'an Temple. The plain mixed noodles and double mushroom noodles are both delicious.
 Jin An is a hustle spalce. But when you get inside of the temple, it's quiet, different from the hustle and bustle outside</p>

    <h1>Around Jin'An Temple</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Jing 'an Temple is a good place to go shopping. The shops on Nanjing West Road in front of the temple are almost synonymous with "upscale", selling expensive goods. Jiuguang department store near Jing 'an Temple is famous for its imported goods, especially imported food. Go 1 km east, jiangning Road and Nanjing West road intersection near the Hang Long Plaza, Citic Pacific Plaza, Meilong town Yizidan high-end goods, luxury goods for sale. 
        Another road next to Jing 'an Temple, Huashan Road, is full of "xiaozi" sentiment. Under the plane trees covering the sky, there are a bunch of small houses, suitable for lovers to "hit the road". 
        Jing 'an Park opposite Jing 'an Temple has some restaurants with very good environment, such as Bali Island, which has outdoor seating near the lake. It is very romantic to have dinner in the evening under the flickering lights, and the price is naturally expensive.</p>
